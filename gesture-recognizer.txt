What does the recognizer do?
The $P recognizer  avoids the storage complexity of $N by representing gestures as “clouds of Points”.
and thus ignoring variable user behavior in terms of stroke order and direction. The $P recognizer discards the timeline of gestures what makes gestures appear
as simple sets without any particular order associated. So the points of gesture do not necessarily follow the the previous points. Instead gestures are seen as unordered sets by
grouping points in a cloud. Because time has no importance in this way of implementation the number of strokes, stroke ordering, and stroke direction become irrelevant.

Name an advantage of the $P recognizer over the $1 recognizer.
The $1 recognizer has a combinatoric gesture represenation approach. For example when drawing a square there are 442 possible cases. So $1 recognizer has very high memory and execution costs.
The $P recognizer sees the gesture as an unordered set of grouped points in a cloud without considering the time of a gesture, what leads to very low memory and execution costs.

What is the minimum matching distance?
The minimum matching distance is the best match between two point clouds C and T what can be repesented as Nearest-Neighbour classification.
