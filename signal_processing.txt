What is random noise?
-Random noise is a form of noise consisting of large numbers of frequent, short-living impulses, or disturbances, which occur at statistically random time intervals.


What does a low-pass filter do in general?
-In general a low-pass filter passes signals with a frequency which is lower than a certain cutoff frequency, but cushions signals with a frequency above the cutoff frequency.


Is a moving average filter a low-pass or a high-pass filter? Why?
- A moving average filter can be seen as a low-pass filter. It removes higher frequencies in a signal and smoothes the data. Frequencies below their
 cutoff frequency are almost notreduced and can pass without a modification.
